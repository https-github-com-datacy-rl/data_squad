    "Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are two fundamental algorithms in the field of machine learning, both falling under the category of supervised learning. They are used for different types of prediction problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear Regression is used for regression problems where the goal is to predict continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices, temperatures, sales amounts).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective: To find a linear relationship between the input variables (independent variables) and the output variable (dependent variable). The relationship is modeled through a linear equation:\n",

    "where ùë¶ is the dependent variable, ùë•1,ùë•2,...,ùë•ùëõ are the independent variables, ùõΩ0 is the y-intercept, \n",

    " is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method: The coefficients (ùõΩ) are typically estimated using the least squares technique, minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the linear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assumptions:\n",
    "- Linear relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) have constant variance.\n",
    "- Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- No or little multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Normal distribution of errors.\n",
    "4. Evaluation: R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is used for classification problems where the outcome is categorical \n",
    "- (e.g., email is spam or not spam, a tumor is malignant or benign).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Points:\n",

    "#### Differences between Linear and Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Nature of Dependent Variable: Linear regression is used for predicting continuous variables. Logistic regression is used for predicting binary outcomes (0 or 1, true or false, yes or no).\n",
    "- Function: Linear regression uses the identity function (output is a linear combination of inputs). Logistic regression uses the logistic function to ensure the output lies between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Problem Type: Linear regression is a regression algorithm, while logistic regression is a classification algorithm.\n",
    "Both linear and logistic regression serve as a solid foundation for understanding more complex machine learning algorithms and are often the first algorithms that practitioners learn due to their simplicity and wide range of applications."
